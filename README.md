# Frontend Mentor - Todo app

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app **using react** and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge.

The users should be able to:

- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- **Bonus**: Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- **Bonus**: Refreshing the page will not delete the the current todo list
